This repository is an academic data science project exploring a wide range of **machine learning, data preparation, and time-series analysis techniques**.

The goal was not to build a single optimized model, but to **understand and compare methods**, experiment with different pipelines, and analyze how choices in data preprocessing and modeling affect results.


## What’s Inside (High Level)

The project is organized by **data science stages**:

- **Data profiling**  
  Exploratory analysis of datasets (missing values, distributions, outliers, correlations).

- **Data preparation & encoding**  
  Cleaning, balancing, scaling, encoding, and splitting strategies.

- **Feature engineering**  
  Feature extraction, selection, and dataset-specific transformations.

- **Classification & modeling**  
  Decision Trees, KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, MLPs.

- **Time-series & forecasting**  
  ARIMA, exponential smoothing, rolling averages, persistence models, LSTM.

- **Evaluation & visualization**  
  Comparative evaluation and extensive visual reporting.

The repository includes both **Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks**, along with many generated plots for analysis.

## Project Context

This is an **academic project** developed at **Instituto Superior Técnico**, with an emphasis on:
- learning by experimentation  
- comparing approaches rather than optimizing a single solution  
- documenting results through visualization
